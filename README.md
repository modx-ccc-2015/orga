# Organization Stuff

Soon MODX CCC 2015 takes place. Excited? We are! So, here are some basics you might want/need to know.

But first, we need something from you: Could somebody bring a beamer? We have one (1024x768) and would like to have a second one. Anybody? Contact us (AKA reply). Thank you!

And another thing: In order to reserve enough restaurant chairs for the friday evening get-together-madness, we need to know:
**WHO WANTS TO MUNCH WITH US?**
***Please, Oliver, let us know by replying to this e-mail no later than monday (2nd of Feb.).***

OK, that was that. So, let’s start!

##How to get there?##

#####By plane#####
You fly in? Big shot ;-). From the Airport „Cologne/Bonn“ („Köln/Bonn“) you can use the S-Bahn 13 to travel directly to „Cologne Central Station“ („Köln HBF/Hauptbahnhof“). You’ll need a KVB ticket „1b“ for €2,80. From there, it’s just like for the train travelers, but you can continue to use your KVB ticket and don’t need to buy an extra one.

#####By train#####
If you arrive at „Cologne Central Station“, take the KVB 15 (direction „Ubierring“), KVB 16 (direction „Bad Godesberg Stadthalle“) or 18 (Direction „Bonn West“) and exit at „[Barbarossaplatz](https://www.google.de/maps/place/K%C3%B6ln,+Barbarossaplatz/@50.9286,6.942737,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47bf24559c206c5f:0xdd725fbe8127f8d1)“. You’ll need a KVB ticket „1a“ for €2,40 (max. 4 halts).

If you arrive at „Cologne Deutz“ take the KVB 9 (direction „Sülz Hermeskeiler Platz“) and exit at „[Zülpicher Platz](https://www.google.de/maps/place/K%C3%B6ln,+Z%C3%BClpicher+Platz/@50.931151,6.940769,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47bf24ffe6e91a19:0x94a09d2246228ba8)“. You’ll need a KVB ticket „1b“ for €2,80.

#####By Car#####
Good luck! Parking is no fun. You chould try „[Parkhaus Hohenstaufenring[(http://www.parkopedia.de/parken/tiefgarage/hohenstaufenring/50674/k%C3%B6ln/)“ who charges €17,- for 24h. It’s just around the corner.
Visitors traveling by car need a "Feinstaubplakette" (emission sticker for micro particles) when driving inside Cologne. This is about keeping the air clean – or just another way of getting some money into the city's pockets? Well, this way or another, you should get an Emission sticker for €5,-  — or try your luck. ;-).


##Eating and Drinking##
It’s like hiking: BYOFAD – Bring your own food and drinks. There are plenty of supermarkets, restaurants, takeaways etc. – just around the corner. And a LOT of pubs for the after-code-pleasure.


##Paying in places##
Ze Germans don’t use credit cards very often. We pay via EC-cards or cash. Don’t even think of BitCoins. ;-)
You can get yourself some cash around the corner at the [Sparkasse](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Sparkasse+K%C3%B6lnBonn+-+Gesch%C3%A4ftsstelle/@50.929102,6.9421981,16z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sbarbarossapltz+k%C3%B6ln+bank!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x96655fd7b3a7f5d8) or this [ATM](https://www.google.de/maps/place/K%C3%B6lner+Bank+eG+-+Geldautomat+Rewe+Markt+Z%C3%BClpicher+Platz/@50.929102,6.9421981,16z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sbarbarossapltz+k%C3%B6ln+bank!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x8075935c63b3c1a0). In Restaurants it’s better to have some cash on you.
Hotels should accept EC- and credit cards. VISA or MasterCard are fine, with American Express it’s sometimes difficult. Just ask them to avoid any check-out trouble.

You might want to take another look at the „[CCC wishlist](https://github.com/modx-ccc-2015/whishlist)“ on GitHub to see what others would like to do – or just create/check your own CCC issues.
For the evening, well, we’ll see. There are plenty of possible things to do.
